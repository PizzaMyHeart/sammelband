### CSS modifications for better readability

- Apply `max-width: 80ch` to `<p>` elements (consensus appears to be 50 - 90 characters for optimal line length).
- Set `line-height: calc(1ex / 0.32)` to text elements ([Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/css-techniques-legibility/)).
- Set `margin: calc(1ex / 0.42) 0` to headers and list items (again, thanks to [Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/css-techniques-legibility/)).
- Apply `max-width: 700px` to `<body>` to center the whole shebang.
- Change the sans-serif header fonts from Arial Black/Arial Bold (horrendous) to plain Arial (not ideal, but available everywhere).
- Change `text-align` from `justify` to `start` (I agree with [this sentiment](https://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/voyage-to-nowhere)).
- Authoring HTML email is ðŸ’©&mdash;I've left the CSS as a `<style/>` tag and only removed the left and right margins on `<body>`.
