The protocol utilizes space congestion control over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).</p><h3>What is the relationship between HTTP, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3?</h3><p>While HTTP is really ‘HTTP-over-TCP’ and HTTP/2 might be described as ‘HTTP-over-TCP’ then HTTP/3 might be best described as ‘HTTP/2-over-QUIC’.</p><p>During the <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat" target="_blank">Black Hat</a> Asia 2020 virtual conference, Google engineer Nick Harper explained in some depth how QUIC and HTTP/3 compare to HTTP/2.</p><p><span>RELATED</span> <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat-asia-need-for-global-security-perspectives-underlined-at-virtual-event" target="_blank">Black Hat Asia: Need for global security perspectives underlined at virtual event</a></p><p>Harper argued that the HTTP/3 protocol stack has “equivalent security as HTTP/2”, adding that HTTP/3’s use of QUIC improves performance while QUIC enhances <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/privacy" target="_blank">privacy</a>.</p><p>HTTP/3 is largely similar to HTTP/2 in high-level features, though their implementation differs, Robin Marx, a PhD researcher specializing in web performance at Hasselt University, Belgium, told <i>The Daily Swig</i>.</p><p><img src="/cms/images/b6/d8/e8cb-article-201002-gruss-body-text.jpg" alt="HTTP3 web protocol will have security benefits" title="Image credit: spainter_vfx / Shutterstock"><span>HTTP/3 might be best described as ‘HTTP/2-over-QUIC’</span></p><br><h3>What are the benefits of the HTTP/3 protocol?</h3><p>The switch to QUIC goes a long way towards resolving a major problem of HTTP/2, namely ‘head of line blocking’.</p><p>Because the parallel nature of HTTP/2’s multiplexing is not visible to TCP’s loss recovery mechanisms, a lost or reordered packet causes all active transactions to stall regardless of whether a particular transaction was impacted by the lost packet or not.</p><p>Since QUIC provides native multiplexing, lost packets only impact the streams where data has been dropped.</p><p>The practical effect of the upgrade to HTTP/3 is to reduce the latency of poor or lossy internet connections.</p><p><span>RECOMMENDED</span> <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/coronavirus-how-to-work-from-home-securely-during-a-period-of-isolation" target="_blank">Coronavirus: How to work from home securely during a period of isolation</a></p><p>QUIC is almost entirely encrypted, meaning security should also be significantly improved with HTTP/3.</p><p>This built-in encryption means fewer opportunities for <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/mitm" target="_blank">manipulator-in-the-middle</a>&nbsp;(MitM) attacks, while QUIC also includes other features that help protect against denial of service exploits, according to Marx.</p><p>QUIC combines its cryptographic and transport handshakes in a way that allows connection to a new server in a single round trip. The same technology allows an interrupted connection to be quickly resumed, with the client sending encrypted application data in its first flight.</p><p>QUIC uses TLS 1.3 as the building blocks for its cryptographic handshake.</p><h3>How well supported is HTTP/3?</h3><p>As of October 2020, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-31" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HTTP/3 protocol is an internet draft standard</a> and has multiple implementations.</p><p>Nearly 8% of the top 10 million websites support HTTP/3, according to the <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">latest figures from W3Techs</a>.</p><p>HTTP/3 has non-default support in stable versions of the Chrome (since December 2019) and Firefox (since January 2020) <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/browsers" target="_blank">browsers</a>.</p><h3>What advantages will be gained from rolling out HTTP/3?</h3><p>Backers of HTTP/3 reckon that the technology will offer faster website load time and better performance, particularly on loss-prone networks, compared to earlier technologies.</p><p>Achiel van der Mandele, product manager at Cloudflare, explained: “Simply put, we believe that HTTP/3 will make the internet better for everyone. HTTP/3 is the successor to HTTP/2, offering improved performance when loading websites.</p><p>“Users of HTTP/3 will benefit from faster connection setup and better performance on low-quality networks with high amounts of packet loss. Both of these improvements ensure that websites load faster and more reliably,” Mandele told <span>The Daily Swig</span>.</p><p>Marx was more cautious in talking up the benefits of HTTP/3.</p><p>“Performance should also benefit, though not by that much in practice,” he said. “The head-of-line blocking removal doesn’t matter *that* much for [things like] web page loading.</p><p>“Most gains will be from the shorter handshake setup times,” he explained, adding that HTTP/3 and QUIC represent an “evolution, not a revolution”.</p><p>“Performance will be better, but not in a super-noticeable way for things like web browsing,” Marx said. “Security should be better and protect against several attack types.”</p><p><img src="/cms/images/cf/e1/fb2a-article-200611-tls-body-text.jpg" alt="HTTP3 may be difficult to implement, but does have security benefits" title="Image credit: Majcot / Shutterstock"><span>HTTP/3 is said to offer faster website loading time and better performance</span></p><h3>What challenges lie ahead for deploying HTTP/3?</h3><p>Rustam Lalkaka, director of product at Cloudflare, offered <span>The Daily Swig</span> a list of obstacles to be overcome in deploying HTTP/3. This includes getting the technology to work with load balancers and deep packet inspection devices (so called ‘<a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/https-everywhere-cloudflare-planning-improvements-to-middleware-detection-utility" target="_blank">middleboxes</a>’), as well as building up browser support:</p><ul><li><span>Software built to support QUIC and HTTP/3 is still new and rapidly evolving</span>. “We’ve been heartened to see strong cross-industry partnerships working well to address interoperability issues as they arise. We expect to continue finding and fixing issues as the standard and various implementations mature.”</li><li><span>Transit providers between networks (or in some cases even ISPs) may run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">middleboxes</a> that have historically been hostile to UDP traffic</span>. “To unlock the full benefits of QUIC and allow all clients to use it, some networks with hostile middleboxes may need to make configuration adjustments.”</li><li><span>Enabling QUIC for many server operators is complicated</span>. “For example, for customers of Cloudflare, enabling HTTP/3 is straightforward: just hit the HTTP/3 toggle on the dashboard and anyone visiting their site with a compatible browser will access it over the new protocol.”</li><li><span>Client support is still not totally mainstream</span>. “Google <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/Chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a> has recently enabled HTTP/3 on QUIC for ~95% of their browsers; we expect other major browser vendors to follow suit now that the HTTP/3 with QUIC IETF standard has entered its final draft. Firefox and <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/safari" target="_blank">Safari</a> have support in earlier stages of maturity.”</li></ul><p>Cloudflare explained how it was preparing for HTTP/3 in a detailed <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">technical blog post</a> that serves as a good introduction to the technology.</p><p>Marx added that some networks will “consciously block QUIC because firewalls” can, for example, no longer track connection setup or QUIC transport header information.</p><p>“Packet numbers, acknowledgements, options... are all encrypted in QUIC,” Marx explained. “QUIC only works when encrypted and browsers currently don't work too well with self-signed certificates or ‘in-house’ root certificates.”</p><p>Load balancers need to be adjusted to deal with QUIC’s connection IDs and connection migration features.</p><p>Advanced features like 0-RTT (round trip time) have a strong security aspect, involving the creation of Session Ticket Encryption keys and protection against&nbsp;replay attacks, Marx added.</p><h3>When will QUIC and HTTP/3 become mainstream technologies?</h3><p>QUIC discovery is complex, since HTTP/2 connections cannot simply be upgraded to QUIC the same way HTTP/1.1 is upgraded to HTTP/2. This is because QUIC runs over UDP and not TCP.</p><p>Given this implementation barrier, Marx said that over the next few years HTTP/3 is “probably something you get when using a content delivery network or external service provider, not something you’ll be setting up on your own servers (for most people)”.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq_xk_Pecu4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=989" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">conference talk</a> and related <a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2018/quic-and-http-3-too-big-to-fail/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> by Marx on preparing for HTTP/3-over-QUIC, delivered at the O’Reilly Velocity Berlin conference last year, discusses many of the practical issues ahead in deploying the technology.</p><p>Marx concluded: “QUIC is still a very powerful protocol and many of the performance gains will come down the line as the protocol is much easier than TCP to evolve/tweak and new best practices will emerge.</p><p>“Still, it is highly complex, and it will take time for the wider community to really understand how it works and how to use it.”</p><p><span>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE</span> <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/http-2-pinged-by-ddos-vulnerabilities">HTTP/2 pinged by DDoS vulnerabilities</a></p>
